Ian's Notes - 8.14.22
So close!  Everything works, except that the URL has to be put in manually.  Something about that API call isn't working.

I think it has to do with when it's being called, which I can experiment with, but it could also be a protection from BGG.

Let's take a look at the error message and chat.  But very clsoe!


TODO:
