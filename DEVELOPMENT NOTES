IANS DESPERATE NOTES FROM 8.6.22
1. At 50, the JSON.parse does not turn the xml <data> into json <games>.  
THis is perplexing, because the same syntax DOES turn the xml <data> into the json <collectionData at line 45.  
Did this work once? I assume it must have for you to have copied the result into games.json manually, but now we get an error at that step.

2. At 46, setbggData isn't actually setting the bggData state.  
That doesn't matter so much there, but when I tried to set state later on, it also didn't make a change.  
I'm not sure what's happening there, because other state variables are getting set properly.

3.  This is all preliminary stuff, so I haven't even gotten to the meat of what I want to work on.  
But if we can figure out the above, it should be straightforward. 
I'm writing down the method here so I don't forget: wrap the API call in a useEffect.  
Add a line to handleSubmit to update a state like userName to that is in the box when submitted, and add a dependency to the useEffect of userName. 
That should mean it only gets called when we click submit.  Then, use ${} to put userName in the correct spot in the URL.  
Finally, set the state of a variable to be the JSON that is meant to be at <games> and pass that into the sort function.
